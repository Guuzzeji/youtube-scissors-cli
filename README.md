A simple CLI app that allows you to divide a YouTube video into multiple separate videos base on a video's time stamps. This project is built on top of another one of my projects, [yt-scissors](https://github.com/Guuzzeji/yt-scissors). 


## üí° Features
- Can generate multiple videos or extract a single video, based on a YouTube video's time stamps (time stamps from a comment, video description, or chapters)
  - **Important:** Generated time stamps from the description and comments works about 85% of the time. Make sure the video's time stamps are spaced out and have nothing that would make it hard to find them. There is also a bug with any video that is +10 hours long, so video length should be below 10 hours.
  
  - **Note:** Make sure the description or comment has a full time stamp list for the best results.

- Can download videos directly from CLI
  - **Note:** Downloading is slow compare to other YouTube download methods.
  
  - If you need good download speeds try [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) or [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). You can still use this program with other YouTube download methods.

- Can process already downloaded YouTube videos
  
- Simple CLI structure
  
- 100% Open Source (MIT license)


## üìÇ How to Download & Install

1. Download it [here](https://github.com/Guuzzeji/youtube-scissors-cli/releases) or go to the release tab of this repository.

2. Once you downloaded the YouTube-Scissors-CLI executable, download ffmpeg. [FFmpeg Downloads](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   
3. After downloading ffmpeg, open up the config.json file and paste the path to where you have saved the ffmpeg executable. Make sure you put config.json in the same directory as your YouTube-Scissors executable. 

4. Edit config.json to your liking. 

**Example of How config.json is Setup**
```js
{
    "ffmpeg_path": "Your ffmpeg executable path goes here",
    "hide_ffmpeg": true, // hides ffmpeg logs
    "hide_yt_download": true, // hides download logs
    "hide_logo": false // hides youtube-scissors banner on startup
}
```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage 

1. Find a YouTube video that you want to extract videos from
   - Make sure the YouTube video has either chapters or time stamps in the description or comments section
  
   - **Note:** For comments, follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnmfkLiMLHs) to figure out how to get a YouTube comment's URL.

   - **Tip:** Make sure the description or comment has a full time stamp list for the best results.

2. Run YouTube-Scissors CLI and paste the YouTube video's URL or the YouTube comment's URL

3. Then enter in what you want for each prompt
   - **Important:** When extracting multiple videos, YouTube-scissors will NOT create a folder for all the videos to be saved in. You must create an empty folder beforehand and save all the videos there.
